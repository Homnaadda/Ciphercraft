### Comprehensive Plan for Task Execution

#### Information Gathered:
- The `templates/AES.html` file has been updated with new content, including a more detailed overview of AES, key expansion, encryption and decryption processes, and real-world applications.
- The `templates/DES.html` file provides a similar structure for DES, but it needs to be updated to ensure consistency with the changes made to the AES content.
- The `templates/Simulation/AES_Simulation.html` file serves as a demo for AES encryption, and it includes links to the AES page and other simulations.
- The `templates/index.html` file contains links to AES, DES, and RSA, which need to be verified for correctness.

#### Plan:
1. **Update `templates/DES.html`:**
   - Ensure that all links point to the correct routes (e.g., `/AES`, `/RSA`, `/simulation/DES`, etc.).
   - Review the content to ensure it aligns with the updated AES content, particularly in terms of structure and educational focus.

2. **Update `templates/AES_Simulation.html`:**
   - Verify that the links within this file point to the correct routes for AES and other simulations.
   - Ensure that the demo accurately reflects the AES content and provides a clear educational experience.

3. **Update `templates/index.html`:**
   - Verify that all links to AES, DES, and RSA point to the correct routes.
   - Ensure that the content reflects the educational goals of the project.

4. **Update `templates/Simulation/DES_Simulation.html`, `templates/Simulation/AES_Simulation.html`, and `templates/Simulation/RSA_Simulation.html`:**
   - Ensure that all simulation links point to the correct routes.
   - Review the content to ensure it aligns with the educational objectives of the project.

#### Dependent Files to be edited:
- `templates/DES.html`
- `templates/AES_Simulation.html`
- `templates/index.html`
- `templates/Simulation/DES_Simulation.html`
- `templates/Simulation/AES_Simulation.html`
- `templates/Simulation/RSA_Simulation.html`

#### Followup Steps:
- After making the updates, test all links to ensure they work correctly and lead to the appropriate pages.
- Verify that the content is consistent and educational across all files.
- Run the application to ensure that all functionalities are working as expected.
